# Chemistry-WebApps-in-Javascript
A collection of web-apps for research and teaching. Written in Javascript/HTML.
- All web-apps are self-contained CSS/HTML/Javascript files for portability.
- Start with the Chem_webapps_frontpage.html file for links to all apps!
- functionalities include:
    * Read in a CSV with a list of SMILES and target values and train a neural network to predict the target values. Can be saved to your local machine and used later for predictions.
    * Read in a CSV file of SMILES strings and generate novel molecules by creating substitutions on aromatic rings. 
    * Selecting or drawing molecules and calculating ADME properties in Javascript.
    * Upload or generate a basis set of orbitals or geminals for 1 and 2-electrons and use stochastic optimization to find the ground state energy.
    * Calculate all properties (energy levels, wave functions, probabilities, transition wavelengths, etc) for a user-defined 1 dimensional particle in a box.
    * Calculate energy, entropy, enthalpy, heat and work for isochoric, isothermal, adiabatic, and isobaric processes. 
    * Calculating and visualizing solid/liquid contact angles in Javascript.
    * Predicting and drawing rovibrational spectra of diatomic molecules in Javascript.
    * Performing lab calculations in Javascript.
